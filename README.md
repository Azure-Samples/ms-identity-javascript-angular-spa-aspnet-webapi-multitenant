# Developing a multi-tenant (SaaS) application on Microsoft identity platform

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of Angular 11 and MSAL Angular v2.

Check it out: [Multi-tenant (SaaS) Angular single-page application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-tutorial/blob/main/6-Multitenancy/1-call-api-mt/README.md)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the [master branch](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa-aspnet-webapi-multitenant/tree/master), but please know that it's no longer maintained.
